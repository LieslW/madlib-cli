******************************
**  ***** WELCOME *****     **
** Thank you for partaking  **
** in my first MadLib game. **
**  Madlib is a fun phrasal **
** template word game that  **
** prompts the player for a **
**  list of words to sub in **
**  for blanks in a story.  **
** The stories usually come **
**  out quite comedic when  **
**  the reader reads them   **
**  out for the first time. **
**   Try it out below and   **
**    follow the prompts!   **
**         HAVE FUN!        **
